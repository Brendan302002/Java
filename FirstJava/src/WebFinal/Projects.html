        <p>Project one was to recreate flappy bird, and we utilized C# and Unity to create a 2D version, with random spawning pipes. We learned basic RigidBody components, as well as Collider components in this project</p>

          <p>Our third project in Game Engines class was to create a minigolf game, in 3D. This taught us a lot about the 3D physics of unity, as well as controlling and aiming with a mouse, as well as keyboard. It allowed us to also explore 3D Models, meches and more</p>

          <p>During Janurary to April every year, there is a highschool program, called First Robotics that tasks highschool students to build a robot to do a task and acheive points. I was a student on the team at Oakridge SS when I was in highschool, which is what pushed me towards programming. Now, I help as a mentor to the current students, and teach them new and exciting things</p>
