        <p>&lt;Hi, My name is Brendan Goddard, I am a photographer, as well as a software student at Fanshawe College in London Ontario. In addition to classes, I spend my time doing photography, and working with highschool students on Robots/&gt;</p>
        <p>&lt;With this website, I used gradients in CSS in order to make the backgrounds you see on each page. I wanted this portfolio to be a extension of my skills as well as a showcase of the things I have done in my personal life, and other classes. There is a gallery page, which shows some photos I have taken, as well as there is a projects page, which shows games and robots I have built, and finally the contact page includes links to all of my social media, as well as a section to email me./&gt;</p>
